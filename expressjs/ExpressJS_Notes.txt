-> What is an ExpressJS?
    - an ExpressJS is a Web Application Framework for NodeJS
    - It provides various features that make Web Application Development
    - ExpressJS is based on the NodeJS Middleware Module called 'connect' which is in turn uses the 'http' Module

    ExpressJS -> connect -> http -> NodeJS

-> Features of ExpressJS:
    1. Makes NodeJS Web Application Development Fast and Easy
    2. Easy to Configure and Customize
    3. Allows you to define Routes of your Application based on HTTP Methods and URL's
    4. Includes various Middleware Modules which you can perform additional Tasks on Request and Response
    5. Easy to Integrate with Different Template Engines like JADE, EJS, etc.
    6. Allows you to Define an Error Handling Middleware.
    7. Easy to Serve Static Files and Resources of your Application
    8. Allows you to Create REST API Server
    9. Easy to Connect with Databases such as MongoDB, Redis, MySql etc., 

-> Define Routes:
    - use 'app' object to define different routes of your application
    - the 'app' object includes get(), post(), put(), and delete() methods to define routes for HTTP GET, POST, PUT and DELETE requests respectively

-> Handle POST Request: 
    - to handle the POST Request, you need to create the form let's say ex., index.html
    - when you are working with form data, then you have to discuss about 'Body Parser'
    - Body Parser: to handle the HTTP POST request in express, we have to install the middleware - body-parser
    - the Middleware was a part of Express earlier
    - the 'body-parser' Module parses the JSON, Buffer, String and URL encoded data submitted using HTTP POST request.
    - >>> npm install body-parser
