-> What is Javascript?
    - Javascript is an Open Source Client Side Scripting / Programming Language
    - To make the Web Pages more Interactivity

-> What we can do with Javascript?
    - Modify the Content of a Web Page by Adding / Removing
    - Change the Style and Position of the Element
    - Monitor Events like., Click, Hover, Blur, Change, Focus, etc., 
    - Perform and Control the Trasitions and Transforms like Animations
    - Display the Popups like., alert(), confirm(), prompt()
    - Perform Actions on Inputs

-> Getting Started:
    - External
    - Embedded
    - Inline

-> Display the Data: 
    - There are 3 different ways
    - document.write()
    - console.log() / console.warn() / console.error()
    - alert() / confirm() / prompt()

-> Commenting: 
    - Skipping the Statement(s) at the time of Execution
    - There are 2 ways of Commenting
        1. Single - // ............. 
        2. Multi - /* ..... */

-> Data Types: 
    - Data: a data is a value which it can be presented in the results
    - Types of Data: 
        - There are 2  different data types: 
        1. Primitive 
            1. Number: 0 - 9; 643, 45, -355, -12, 4e3, 4**32
            2. String: a - z; A - Z; 0 - 9; %$^^%$# - ' .... ' / " ... " / ` ... `
            3. Boolean: true / false

        2. Non Primitive

-> Identifiers and Keywords: 
    - Identifiers: an Identifier is a name which is used to Identify the Concept: Variable, Functions, Arrays, Object, etc., 
    - Rules in Declaring the Identifiers: 
        1. The Starting Character should be either a - z, A - Z, _
        2. From the Second Character, it can be either a - z, A - Z, 0 - 9, _ 
        3. No Spaces are Allowed
        4. No Symbols are Allowed except _
        5. Can be a Combination of LowerCase and UpperCase Characters

    - examples: username, _username, user_name, userName, _userName, 1num (x)

-> Keywords: 
    - a Keyword is a Builtin / PreDefined
    - list of Keywords: if, async, promise, class, function etc., 

-> Declaring the Variables: 
    - What is a Variable? 
    - a Variable is a name which is used to Store / Hold the Value

    - There are 3 different ways to declare the variables: 
        1. var 
        2. let 
        3. const 

-> With the Keyword of 'var'
-> With the Keyword of 'let'
-> With the Keyword of 'const'

-> Working with Operators:
    - an operator is a symbol which is used to evaluate the expression
    - there are 
        1. arithmatic operators 
        2. assignent operators 
        3. comparision (relational operators) 
        4. conditional (ternary) operators 
        5. logical operators

-> Statements:
    1. Decision Making Statements: 
        - if, if else, if if, if else if else, switch case
    2. Loop Statements: 
        - while, do while, for 

-> Array: 
    - an array is a set of diferent items / elements 

-> Functions: 
    - a function is re usable set of statements
    - which can be accessible at any point of time and / or n no of places
    - function call and its defintion
    - passing parameters to function 
    - return statement
    - anonymous function
    - arrow function

    - functions with event handlers

-> Events and Event Handlers:
    - list of some event handlers: onclick, onblur, onfocus, onchange etc., 

-> Strings: 
-> Numbers: 
-> Array: 
-> Sorting of Arrays: 

-> Objects: 
    - an object is a collection of named values
    - these named values are usually referred to as a properties of an object.

    - manipulating by value vs 
    - manipulating by reference

    - objects are reference types - when you make copies of them - 
    you are copying the reference to that object

-> DOM: 
    - DOM stands for Document Object Model
    - It is a model to represent the HTML or XML documents
    - It defines the logical structure of the document and that can manipulated
    - In the DOM, all parts of the document such as elements, attributes, text, etc., are organized in a hierarchical tree - like structure;

    - Selectors
    - Styling
    - GET and SET Attributes
    - Manipulation

    - Navigation
        types of DOM Nodes
            - the DOM tree consists of different types of Nodes., such as., Elements, Text, Comments etc., 
            - ELEMENT_NODE
            - TEXT_NODE
            - COMMENT_NODE
            - DOCUMENT_NODE
            - DOCUMENT_TYPE_NODE

    - Objects: 
        - Window
        - Screen
        - Location
        - History
        - Navigator

    - Dialog Boxes:
        - alert()
        - prompt()
        - confirm()

    - Timers: 
        - setTimeout()
        - setInterval()

    - Date and Time:
    - Math Operations: 

    - Event Listeners: 
        - the event listeners are just like 'event handlers' 
        - except that you can assign as many event listeners as you like to a particular event on particular element

    -> Event Propagation:
        - the event propagation is a mechanism that defines how events propagate or travel through the DOM tree to arrive its target and what happens to it afterward

        - the capturing phase:
        - bubbling phase:
        
        - stop event propagation: 
            - event.stopPropagation()

        - preventDefault()

    - Borrowing Methods: 
        - apply(), call()

        - the difference between call() and apply() methods: 
            - the apply() method is using the list of arguments in array format

    - Hoisting: 
        - all variables and function declarations are moved or hoisted to the top of their current scope

    - closure: 
        - a function returns as a reference to another function

    - Getter and Setter functions: 
    - Strict Mode: 

    - JSON: 
        - JSON stands for Javascript Object Notation
        - The JSON is a Character Based Data Transmission between Client and Server
        - two things: object & array

    - Error Handling: 
        - try... catch throw finally
        - Errors: RangeError, ReferenceError, SyntaxError, TypeError
        
    - Regular Expressions: 
        - a Regular Expression can alse called as 'regex' or 'RegExp' 
        - it a specially formatted text strings to find patterns in text
        - exec(), test(), search(), match(), replace(), split()

    - Form Validation: 
        - name, email, mobile, url, password 

    - ES6 Features: 
        - ES6 full form ECMAScript6

    - Object Declartion
        - Properties 
        - Methods

    - Class: 
        - a class is a template with properties and methods
        - class definition with constructor

    - Inheritance: 

    - promise: 
        - 

    - Cookies: 
        - document.cookie
        - name="php", 
        domain="http://php.net", 
        path="http://php.net/cookies.php", 
        expiry="date"

    - LocalStorage and SessionStorage:
        - the data in localStorage doesn't expire
        - the data in sessionStorage will expire when the page session ends 

        - setItem()
        - getItem()
        - removeItem()
        - clear()
